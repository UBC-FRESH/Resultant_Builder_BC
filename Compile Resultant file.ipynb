    "Note: for those downloading from the DataBC site, and using an AOI to define the interest area they downloaded layers are not clipped to the AOI but rather are clipped to the smallest square (or rectangle that contains all points of the AOI). This means that if you have an AOI that is in different sections (i.e. a planning area that is not continuous) it will use a rectangle that covers all the points. This may require splitting the AOI into two sections. This case is not included in the code, but it can be adapted to accomidate this.\n",
