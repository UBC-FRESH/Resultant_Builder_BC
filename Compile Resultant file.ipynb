Preparing Layers
This code takes layers directly downloaded from the Data BC catalogue and prepares them for the creation of a database for landscape level planning. There are a few starting steps that cannot be automated as they are specific to each project.

1. Create a feature class of the area of interest (AOI) for the dataset. 
2. Download data - users might need to use their AOI to work around max download amounts.
Note: for those downloading from the DataBC site, and using an AOI to define the interest area they downloaded layers are not clipped to the AOI but rather are clipped to the smallest square (or rectangle that contains all points of the AOI). This means that if you have an AOI that is in different sections (i.e. a planning area that is not continuous) it will use a rectangle that covers all the points. This may require splitting the AOI into two sections. This case is not included in the code, but it can be adapted to accomidate this.

3. Create a file geodatabase named "Data_Inputs.gdb" in a file location that makes logical sense for the analysis. 
4. Create a file geodatabase named "Data_Prep.gdb" in a file location that makes logical sense for the analysis.
