# Resultant_Builder_BC
Compile resultant file walks the user through how to build a standard BC forestry dataset for Landscape level forest modeling. This section of code is designed to run in the ArcPro internal Python kernel and not directly through a Jupyter notebook. Long-term plans include updating this code to run and function outside of the Acr/Ersi environments.

For the compile resultant file there is an additional supporting PDF documentation called "Data for LLFMP" which talks about the data requirements and how to most efficiently search for the required data from the DataBC catalogue.

The second sections of code are the start of adapting yield curve building code designed by Dr. Gregory Paradis to work with the compiled Resultant file and generate yield curves. This section of code is currently incomplete. The code that is being adapted can be found under UBC-FRESH/wbi_ria_yield.
